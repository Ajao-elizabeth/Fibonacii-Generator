# Fibonacci Generator – Internship Project

A compact Python project that generates the Fibonacci sequence using:
- Iterative method  
- Recursive method  
- A Tkinter-based GUI  
- Matplotlib visualization

This project demonstrates algorithm design, GUI development, and basic data plotting.

## Features
- **Iterative Fibonacci:** Fast and suitable for large values.
- **Recursive Fibonacci:** Simple mathematical form.
- **Tkinter GUI:** User enters number of terms, and results display instantly.
- **Matplotlib Plot:** Visual line graph of the sequence.

## How It Works
1. User enters the number of terms.
2. Program computes the sequence (iterative or recursive).
3. Output appears in the console or GUI.
4. A matplotlib graph shows how the sequence grows.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python algorithm implementation  
- Recursive vs. iterative logic  
- GUI building with Tkinter  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib  
- Writing clean, modular code  

## Future Improvements
- Add memoization for faster recursion  
- Save plots automatically  
- Enhanced GUI layout
